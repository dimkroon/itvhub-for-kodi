00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:-3
Can I help you?
<c.yellow>Ah!</c>

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>We've got an appointment</c>
<c.yellow>to see the doctor.</c>

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.640 align:middle line:-2
No, you haven't.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Yes, we have.</c>
That's impossible.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:-3
The surgery's closed
and has been for some time.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:-2
You'll have to go to Wadebridge.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Oh, well... I spoke</c>
<c.yellow>to a Dr Ellingham yesterday.</c>

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.960 align:middle line:-3
No, you didn't.
<c.yellow>Uh, excuse me, yes, I did.</c>

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I was told to come here</c>
<c.yellow>at 9am this morning, so...</c>

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>you're very much mistaken.</c>
BABY GURGLES

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>What?</c>

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Oh, this is ridiculous.</c>
<c.yellow>My child's here to see the doctor.</c>

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:-3
I told you -
you'll have go to Wadebridge.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Martin. They're here to see me.</c>

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Come in, I'm so sorry.</c>
<c.yellow>Thank you.</c>

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>You must be Dr Ellingham.</c>

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Oh, no, no, I'm not...</c>
She's not a doctor.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>No, I am a qualified</c>
<c.cyan>child counsellor, though.</c>

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Pretty much the same thing,</c>
<c.yellow>isn't it? </c>No, it isn't.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:-3
Why are you so breathless?
<c.yellow>Well, I don't know.</c>

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Cos you live at the top of a hill.</c>

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Martin, don't you think</c>
<c.cyan>it's about time for her nap?</c>

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:-2
No. 20 minutes yet.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Aw. What's your name?</c>

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Mary.</c>
Mary Elizabeth.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>She's four months...</c>
Nearly.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>They're so cute at that age.</c>
<c.yellow>Shame it doesn't last, eh?</c>

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Come through.</c>
<c.yellow>Come on.</c>

James, the white wheel
goes at the top, not the green.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Thank you.</c>
You're welcome.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Sorry for that confusion,</c>
<c.cyan>Martin used to be a doctor.</c>

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Well, well, he still is,</c>
<c.cyan>he's just not practising any more.</c>

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>So we still get people</c>
<c.cyan>regularly knocking at the door,</c>

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>expecting the surgery to be open,</c>
<c.cyan>and... and it's not.</c>

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Well, I've just moved here,</c>

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>so I wouldn't know about</c>
<c.yellow>any of that.</c>

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Oh, do you work locally?</c>
<c.yellow>From home.</c>

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Yeah, I run my own</c>
<c.yellow>small graphic design business -</c>

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>wedding invitations and the like.</c>

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Or if you need any business cards,</c>
<c.yellow>I can offer you a good rate.</c>

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Well, I'll bear that in mind.</c>
<c.cyan>So, you must be Dylan.</c>

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Are you looking forward</c>
<c.cyan>to starting at the school?</c>

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Say hello to the doctor, Dylan.</c>

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Erm, no, I'm not a doctor.</c>

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I'm Mrs Ellingham, or you can</c>
<c.cyan>call me Louisa if you want.</c>

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Look, he's been like this</c>
<c.yellow>for a while.</c>

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Moody, withdrawn.</c>

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I'm just a bit worried about him,</c>
<c.yellow>aren't I?</c>

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I am in the middle of</c>
<c.yellow>a D-I-V-O-R-C-E, so...</c>

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Yeah, well, why don't you</c>
<c.cyan>take a seat outside,</c>

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>and Dylan and I will,</c>
<c.cyan>will have a little chat,</c>

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>we'll get to know each other.</c>

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>OK. Don't give the nice doctor</c>
<c.yellow>any of your nonsense, all right?</c>

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I don't want to sign the petition.</c>
<c.yellow>I just want some cough medicine.</c>

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:-2
It's store policy.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:-3
If you want something,
you need to sign.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I'll go somewhere else, then.</c>
Fine.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.960 align:middle line:-3
Don't complain to me if your cough
turns into bronchial pneumonia

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.480 align:middle line:-3
and there's no doctor about
to help you!

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Sally.</c>

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:-3
Before you purchase your product,
you need to sign the petition.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I don't think</c>
<c.cyan>you should be doing this.</c>

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:-3
Well, it's my shop,
I'm perfectly within my rights.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>How many signatures you got?</c>
Every flood starts with a trickle.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Doesn't matter</c>
<c.cyan>if you've got 5,000 signatures,</c>

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>you're not gonna change anything.</c>

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>The doc's made his decision.</c>

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:-3
Someone has to change his mind,
then.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>The doc doesn't change his mind.</c>

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.960 align:middle line:-3
Cos he's forgotten what it's like
to be out there, saving lives.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle line:-2
It's the thrill of it all.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>It's not like you can just</c>
<c.cyan>conjure up</c>

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>some medical emergency</c>
<c.cyan>out of nowhere.</c>

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>You know, maybe it's time to,</c>
<c.cyan>you know...</c>

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:-3
Escalate it.
<c.cyan>..let it go.</c>

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:-3
You're right.
<c.cyan>I am?</c>

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.960 align:middle line:-2
Of course.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:-2
Oh, like you said,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:-3
it's not like I can conjure up
a medical emergency from nowhere.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:-2
You know, bring him to his senses.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>OK. Good.</c>

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Good talk.</c>

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:-2
For the doctor.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:-2
STAPLE GUN CLICKS

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:-2
Ow!

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>These are what we call</c>
<c.cyan>"feeling cards".</c>

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Do any of these rabbits here</c>

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>remind you of how you feel</c>
<c.cyan>about your parents separating?</c>

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>I'm not a rabbit.</c>

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>No. No, I know you're not.</c>
<c.cyan>It's just...</c>

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>this rabbit is happy.</c>

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>And this one is angry.</c>

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>And look, see, this one is sad.</c>

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>I'm eight years old.</c>

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>OK. Yeah. No rabbits, then.</c>

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>I'm not the problem.</c>

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>It's my mum.</c>

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>What about your mum?</c>

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>She's...</c>

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>..she's gone weird.</c>

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Looks complicated. Probably easier</c>
<c.yellow>just to buy a new one.</c>

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:-2
Can I help you?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Er, I need a glass of water,</c>
<c.yellow>if that's OK.</c>

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:-2
Yes. I'll get it.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Thank you.</c>
You're welcome.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:-2
SHE COUGHS

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.960 align:middle line:-2
SHE RETCHES

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.960 align:middle line:-2
SHE COUGHS

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>God. Some folk say that it's rude</c>
<c.yellow>to stare, you know.</c>

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>What are you doing?!</c>
I'm just checking something.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Get your hands off me!</c>

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>It's like her batteries</c>
<c.green>have run out. </c><c.cyan>Mm.</c>

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Sometimes she goes to bed</c>
<c.green>before me...</c>

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:-3
MUFFLED: <c.yellow>No. I've been having</c>
<c.yellow>difficulty since I walked in here.</c>

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>..and she still can't get up</c>
<c.green>in the morning.</c>

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:-3
MUFFLED: <c.yellow>..over-stepped your line!</c>
<c.cyan>Sorry, just, er, just a second.</c>

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I don't know you, all right?!</c>

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Who do you think you are?</c>
<c.yellow>We are strangers.</c>

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>But to, sort of, touch me</c>
<c.yellow>and have an opinion on me.</c>

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I only came here because of my son.</c>
<c.yellow>And there you are,</c>

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>you're staring at me like a weirdo.</c>

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Martin? What's going on?</c>

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:-3
She was unable to swallow properly.
<c.yellow>He grabbed my face.</c>

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.000 align:middle line:-3
I didn't grab it. I steadied it.
<c.cyan>Right, OK.</c>

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Martin, I'm with a client. And you</c>
<c.cyan>agreed to stay out the way.</c>

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Yeah, I'm so sorry.</c>

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I can only apologise</c>
<c.cyan>on behalf of myself and Martin.</c>

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:-2
I've done nothing to apologise for.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Well, sorry, but you should!</c>
<c.yellow>Manhandling me!</c>

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:-3
You see, you're still struggling
to breathe. <c.green>Doctor!</c>

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Oh, Doctor, I've had a mishap!</c>

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:-3
No, I-I-I can't treat you,
I'm no longer registered. <c.yellow>See?</c>

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>You're not actually a doctor!</c>

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:-3
MARY CRIES
<c.green>I would have gone to Wadebridge,</c>

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>but I didn't want to bleed</c>
<c.green>all the way there.</c>

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Martin. Mary.</c>
Yes...

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.640 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>No. I'm with a client.</c>

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Fine, I'll go.</c>

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.960 align:middle line:-3
Sit there, Mrs Tishell.
<c.green>Yes.</c>

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.960 align:middle line:-2
Oh. Oh, right.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:-3
I'll remove the staples
and dress the wound...

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>What's wrong with you?</c>
<c.green>Nothing. Nothing's wrong with him.</c>

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>It's just a perfectly</c>
<c.green>normal reaction to blood.</c>

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:-3
Be quiet. I'm fine.
HE CLEARS THROAT

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Sorry.</c>

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:-2
WOMAN: <c.yellow>I want you out!</c>

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I'm fed up with you...</c>
<c.yellow>your bone idleness.</c>

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You can take this...</c>
All right, Dad?

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:-3
Erm... everything OK?
<c.green>Fine, yes. Great.</c>

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:-3
But...
<c.yellow>And this!</c>

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:-3
Oh, I'm here to pick up
the champagne. <c.green>Oh, yes, of course.</c>

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Maybe it's best you come back</c>
<c.green>a bit later, though.</c>

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:-3
Right, because, er...
<c.yellow>Take them... take them all!</c>

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>And good riddance!</c>

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Just a bit of a domestic.</c>

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>If you wanna apologise,</c>
<c.green>I'll be staying at Al's!</c>

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.640 align:middle line:-3
Er, no, no, that's not
a good idea, Dad.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Put this lot in the van.</c>

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>I'm going before she starts</c>
<c.green>throwing down the heavy stuff.</c>

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>I'm so sorry about Martin.</c>

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>He's the one</c>
<c.yellow>who should be apologising.</c>

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I'm stressed. You know?</c>

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>All I wanted was someone</c>
<c.yellow>to make sure that my son was OK.</c>

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I know, and I'd love</c>
<c.cyan>to continue this.</c>

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Dylan, come on. Hurry up.</c>
<c.cyan>I'll be in touch, then. Yeah?</c>

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Come on.</c>

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.960 align:middle line:-2
SHE SIGHS

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.960 align:middle line:-2
There. You can go.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:-3
If the pain continues
or the bleeding starts again,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.960 align:middle line:-3
make an appointment in Wadebridge.
<c.green>Thank you, Doctor.</c>

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>How was it for you?</c>

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.800 align:middle line:-3
How was what?
<c.green>This.</c>

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>You seemed to be back</c>
<c.green>in your element.</c>

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Maybe you needed something</c>
<c.green>like this</c>

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>to remind you</c>
<c.green>of what you've been missing.</c>

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Sometimes we all need a little...</c>
Yes. Thank you.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:-3
We're finished here, Mrs Tishell.
<c.green>Going...</c>

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>going...</c>

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Was all that really necessary?</c>

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:-3
Well, she was bleeding.
<c.cyan>Not Mrs Tishell. Abigail.</c>

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>This is my place of work</c>

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>and you're picking fights</c>
<c.cyan>with my clients. </c>Well, you saw.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:-3
She choked on that water
and her breathing was laboured.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Sounds like you're looking for</c>
<c.cyan>problems that aren't there. </c>I'm not.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>How would you feel if I started</c>
<c.cyan>butting in with your patients?</c>

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:-3
Well, that's not the same thing,
is it?

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:-3
I don't have any patients.
<c.cyan>You don't, no.</c>

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>So stop acting like you do.</c>

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:-3
Why do we still have
this dog's basket?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Oh, no, don't throw it out.</c>

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>James is still attached to it.</c>
<c.cyan>He still misses Buddy.</c>

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:-2
It's been three months.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Maybe we should get a new dog.</c>
Absolutely not.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Are you gonna throw it out, then?</c>
I'll do something with it tomorrow.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Anyone might think</c>
<c.cyan>you missed him, too.</c>

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:-2
Don't be ridiculous.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Erm, sorry, where's all the cutlery?</c>

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:-2
Ah. Er, yes.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle line:-3
I rearranged the drawers to optimise
the usage of space. There.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Doesn't this concern you?</c>

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.960 align:middle line:-2
Why, no, it makes more sense.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>You were considered one of</c>

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>the finest medical minds</c>
<c.cyan>of your generation,</c>

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>and now you spend your time</c>
<c.cyan>fixing an endless supply of clocks</c>

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>and rearranging things</c>
<c.cyan>that don't need rearranging.</c>

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:-2
No, it doesn't concern me.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Well, stop it, because it doesn't</c>
<c.cyan>help when I need to prepare lunch.</c>

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:-3
I've already prepared lunch.
<c.cyan>Of course you have.</c>

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:-2
It's mackerel.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.960 align:middle line:-3
SHE SIGHS
<c.cyan>I know.</c>

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:-2
Mm-hm.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.960 align:middle line:-2
All right, I'm off.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Have you finished already?</c>
Yeah.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:-2
Well, I mean... Well, it is five.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.480 align:middle line:-3
And it's my anniversary, so...
<c.yellow>Of course.</c>

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>It's not like we've got</c>
<c.yellow>a mountain of work to be done.</c>

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Go on, enjoy yourself.</c>

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:-2
I've been here for five months

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:-3
and you've still got me wearing
a trainee badge.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Because you've still got</c>
<c.yellow>a lot to learn, young lady.</c>

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.640 align:middle line:-2
Yeah, well, some people might say

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:-3
it's just an excuse to pay me
a lower wage.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Well, those people would be wrong.</c>

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.960 align:middle line:-2
PRINTER BEEPS

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:-2
So, can I get a promotion, then?

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Here you are.</c>

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Portwenn Paradise Caravan Park.</c>

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Fifteen minutes out of town.</c>

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>We've been trying</c>
<c.yellow>to lease it for a while.</c>

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You get yourself down there</c>
<c.yellow>tomorrow, get it sorted,</c>

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>and we'll, er, see about that badge.</c>

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:-2
OK. Thanks.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.960 align:middle line:-2
Bye.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:-2
TICKING

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Martin? I'm just gonna</c>
<c.cyan>settle Mary down.</c>

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:-3
Right. Yeah.
I'll be up in a minute.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Are you OK?</c>
Mm.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>This looks nice.</c>

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:-2
Yeah, well...

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:-2
We should have gone to a restaurant.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>No. This is perfect, really.</c>

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:-2
DOOR SLAMS

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.960 align:middle line:-2
Almost perfect.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Dinner, oh, great, I'm famished.</c>

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>What are we having?</c>

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:-3
Well, we are having our anniversary
dinner, Dad. I did tell you that.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Oh, yes, right. It's just that</c>
<c.cyan>Caitlin normally cooks my meals.</c>

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:-3
DOOR OPENS
<c.yellow>Oh. And here's Caitlin.</c>

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>I brought the rest of your stuff.</c>
<c.cyan>Just put it over there.</c>

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:-3
Dad was just telling me
how much he misses you, Caitlin.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>No, I said that</c>
<c.cyan>I missed her cooking.</c>

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Look, I'm sure this is all</c>
<c.yellow>just a misunderstanding,</c>

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>and if you talk about it...</c>

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>He's ungrateful. And lazy.</c>

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Maybe start with the positives?</c>

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>She smothers me.</c>
<c.green>Smothers?!</c>

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Exactly.</c>

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>I cook and clean for you.</c>
<c.green>Wash, iron... everything.</c>

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I feel trapped,</c>
<c.cyan>like a bird in a cage.</c>

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>It's not my fault if you're lazy.</c>

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't</c>
<c.green>have a job or a place to sleep.</c>

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Al and Morwenna said I can stay with</c>
<c.cyan>them for the foreseeable future.</c>

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I don't think we have.</c>

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Al and I are gonna go to work</c>
<c.cyan>on his food truck.</c>

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:-2
Er, no, we're not.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>He's doing really well,</c>

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>gone from pulling pints</c>
<c.green>to running his own little empire.</c>

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>He doesn't want you ruining it!</c>

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>With my help and investment, he can</c>
<c.cyan>take things to the next level.</c>

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:-2
Er, I'm... I'm fine, Dad, really.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>You don't have anything to invest.</c>

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>I've got a nest egg.</c>

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:-2
SHE SNIGGERS

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.960 align:middle line:-2
What nest egg?

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Well, don't you think</c>

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I've been squirrelling away</c>
<c.cyan>money for all these years?</c>

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>I just wanted a business to invest.</c>

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>And here we are. It's like fate.</c>

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>I used to think we were fate, too.</c>

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Just shows how wrong you can be.</c>

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>So... did, er...</c>
<c.cyan>someone mention dinner?</c>

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Ooh!</c>

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Morning, Doc.</c>
Yes.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>How's retirement?</c>
I'm not retired.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Oh, you're back at work, then?</c>
No.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:-3
How are you getting on at
the butcher's? <c.yellow>Estate agent.</c>

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:-3
That's right, yes.
<c.yellow>Er, yeah, yeah, it's fine.</c>

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I mean, I spend my time behind</c>
<c.yellow>a desk, buried in paperwork,</c>

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>with a boss who doesn't</c>
<c.yellow>appreciate my talents, so...</c>

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:-2
Right.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>You know...</c>

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>How's little Mary?</c>
Er, she's tiny.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:-3
Where's your mother?
<c.cyan>She's in the car.</c>

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>She says she's too tired</c>
<c.cyan>to do the shopping.</c>

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:-2
Hmm. Excuse me.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.960 align:middle line:-3
Hello!
<c.green>Look at you, perving on people.</c>

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:-3
THEY LAUGH
<c.green>That's not right, that is.</c>

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>No wonder you got the sack.</c>

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:-3
I didn't!
ALL: <c.cyan>Yeah, tosser.</c>

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:-2
You were sleeping.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:-3
Open the window.
<c.yellow>I'm fine. I'm fine.</c>

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.960 align:middle line:-3
You don't seem fine.
Let me look at you.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:-2
Let me look at you!

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Plenty of people</c>
<c.cyan>take a nap in their car.</c>

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Oh... I'm not sure</c>
<c.cyan>a briefcase is necessary, James.</c>

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>You know, most children, they just</c>
<c.cyan>use like a normal bag for school.</c>

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:-2
I took a briefcase to school.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.800 align:middle line:-2
This was no nap.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:-3
When she woke up, she was completely
erratic and disorientated.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Yes. Well, Dylan did say that she,</c>
<c.cyan>erm...</c>

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>she gets tired very easily</c>
<c.cyan>in the evenings.</c>

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Do you think there might be</c>
<c.cyan>something seriously wrong with her?</c>

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:-3
Yeah, I do. I've been doing
some research on it.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Yeah. I wondered what that was.</c>
Oh, Ruth.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I need you to water my plants</c>
<c.yellow>while I'm away.</c>

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:-2
That's not actually something I do.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Well, now it is.</c>

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>It's not as though you're busy.</c>

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Ah. Don't look so worried,</c>
<c.yellow>I'll only be in Mexico for a week.</c>

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Did you say you're going to Mexico?</c>
<c.cyan>I've always wanted to go there.</c>

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Is it for a holiday?</c>
<c.yellow>No, it's work.</c>

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I've been invited to a symposium</c>

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>on violent offenders</c>
<c.yellow>with repeat pattern disorder.</c>

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:-3
Hmm, she's going
to a serial killers' convention.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>That's very reductive of you,</c>
<c.yellow>Martin.</c>

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Though not entirely inaccurate.</c>

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Hello, James Henry.</c>

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Nice briefcase.</c>

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Thank you.</c>

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Martin. Could I have a quiet word?</c>

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:-2
Yes. Yes, of course.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:-2
Yeah. Er, go through.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Oh, it looks different.</c>
Hmm. It is.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:-2
Louisa's using it.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>And you're happy with that?</c>
Yes, course I am.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Then why are we doing</c>
<c.yellow>so much work on your blood phobia?</c>

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:-2
How are they connected?

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Well, I presumed that the plan was</c>

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>that we rectified your mistake</c>
<c.yellow>and you became a doctor again.</c>

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>But now that you've given up</c>
<c.yellow>your consulting room...</c>

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:-2
Well, you can presume all you want.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.960 align:middle line:-3
I never said that I was planning
a return to medicine.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>But it's what you want.</c>

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:-3
I haven't considered all my options.
I've been too busy with Mary.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You've written a paper</c>
<c.yellow>for The Lancet,</c>

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>you're doing extracurricular</c>
<c.yellow>medical research,</c>

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>you're working</c>
<c.yellow>on your blood phobia,</c>

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>you even invented the Ellingham Cup.</c>

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:-2
Well, invented is a strong word.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.800 align:middle line:-3
I just modified, and slightly
improved the existing ventouse.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Exactly. For someone who isn't</c>
<c.yellow>planning to go back to medicine,</c>

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>you seem keenly involved</c>
<c.yellow>in it still.</c>

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:-3
Er, it's...
It's an area of interest.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>You're waiting, aren't you?</c>

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You're waiting for them</c>
<c.yellow>to ask you back.</c>

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.960 align:middle line:-2
No. Of course I'm not.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You know it doesn't work like that.</c>
<c.yellow>You know you have to reach out.</c>

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You have to reach out</c>
<c.yellow>to someone like Chris Parsons.</c>

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>And you haven't, have you?</c>
No, I haven't.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Are you afraid?</c>
Oh, now you're being ridiculous.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Well, if you reach out</c>
<c.yellow>and you're rejected,</c>

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>that's it, it's over,</c>
<c.yellow>there's no going back.</c>

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:-3
You realise this is
all in your mind, don't you?

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:-2
I haven't said a word of this.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Well, that's what concerns me,</c>
<c.yellow>Martin.</c>

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>So much unsaid.</c>

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>So many things that you won't admit.</c>

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Until you do,</c>
<c.yellow>things won't get any better.</c>

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>All that training,</c>
<c.yellow>all those years of practice...</c>

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>to end up mending</c>
<c.yellow>a bunch of old clocks.</c>

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:-2
Well, thank you for your opinions.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:-2
Enjoy your serial killer convention.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I might have found somewhere to</c>
<c.yellow>store the food truck and supplies.</c>

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>It's completely over-priced.</c>
We do need the space.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Oh... Dad's not gonna stay forever.</c>

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.960 align:middle line:-2
Are you asking me or telling me?

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I keep thinking, if I say it enough,</c>
<c.yellow>it'll come true.</c>

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I mean, I love him, but...</c>
I know.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:-3
Just here on the left.
<c.yellow>Oh, right.</c>

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>It's got a certain rustic charm.</c>

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:-3
No-one's gonna want
to rent this dump!

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>No, come on.</c>

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I mean, all it needs is</c>
<c.yellow>a bit of spit and... and polish.</c>

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:-2
I'm gonna be a trainee forever!

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:-2
FLIES BUZZ

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.320 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>What's that?</c>

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:-3
Er, that's the body's
nervous system.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.960 align:middle line:-3
Do you know, if you took it out
and laid it flat,

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle line:-3
it would stretch
for nearly 45 miles.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>A little gory for a four-year-old.</c>
DOORBELL RINGS

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Maybe you could both read the book</c>
<c.cyan>about the talking sausage instead.</c>

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:-3
And we call the study of all this
neurology.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:-3
Can you say that?
<c.green>Neurology.</c>

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:-2
Yes. Very good.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Dylan.</c>

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Is everything OK?</c>
<c.green>Yeah.</c>

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Mum's being weird again.</c>
<c.green>I didn't know where else to go.</c>

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Well, why don't I walk you home</c>
<c.cyan>and we'll see how she is?</c>

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.960 align:middle line:-2
Maybe I should come with you.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>My mum doesn't like you.</c>

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:-2
She doesn't have to.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Well, someone needs to stay home</c>
<c.cyan>and look after the children.</c>

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>So I'll call you</c>
<c.cyan>if there are any problems.</c>

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Oh. I'm fine,</c>
<c.yellow>it's a fuss about nothing.</c>

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>You fell asleep</c>
<c.green>on the kitchen floor.</c>

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>No, look, I just...</c>

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Mummy was tired and I just decided</c>
<c.yellow>to close my eyes for a minute.</c>

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>And snore.</c>

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Yeah. That is a little strange.</c>

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.800 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Oh, look, I'm not disagreeing.</c>

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I've just been under a lot of strain</c>
<c.yellow>recently with the custody battle.</c>

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Yeah, you do seem quite rundown.</c>

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>It's a marathon.</c>

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.320 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>But the finish line is in sight.</c>

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I've got a court hearing</c>
<c.yellow>in the morning, so...</c>

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>fingers crossed.</c>

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Came as fast as I could. </c>Thank you.
You know where everything is.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:-3
There's a sandwich for James here
and I won't be long.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Are you gonna pay me extra?</c>
What for?

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>I had to close my salon</c>
<c.green>to come here, you know.</c>

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:-3
Did you have any customers?
<c.green>That's not the point.</c>

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>You're treating me</c>
<c.green>like a haddock nanny.</c>

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:-3
A what?
<c.green>A haddock nanny.</c>

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>You know,</c>
<c.green>swim in, swim out, no set schedule.</c>

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:-3
Ad-hoc.
<c.green>That's not a word, Doc.</c>

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:-3
I'll pay you what I paid you before.
Thank you.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Look, I know Martin</c>
<c.cyan>isn't registered,</c>

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>but when it comes</c>
<c.cyan>to medical issues...</c>

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>you know, he was a doctor.</c>

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Well, he IS a doctor.</c>

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>He really does know</c>
<c.cyan>what he's talking about.</c>

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Oh, I don't know...</c>

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>The way the custody battle's</c>
<c.yellow>been going,</c>

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I don't want to give my ex</c>
<c.yellow>any more ammunition.</c>

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Anything you discuss with him</c>
<c.cyan>would be completely confidential.</c>

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>And I know it doesn't seem like it,</c>

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>but, you know,</c>
<c.cyan>he does just wanna help.</c>

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:-2
KNOCKING AT DOOR

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Oh, great. That's all I need.</c>
<c.yellow>Let me get rid of them.</c>

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Yeah...</c>
SIGHS

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>What do you want?</c>
I'd like to examine you.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Look... you can't just show up</c>
<c.yellow>on people's doorsteps</c>

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>and start harassing them.</c>

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:-3
You have ptosis.
Your eyelids are drooping.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>What...?! You're not a doctor!</c>

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.960 align:middle line:-3
That's a technicality.
<c.yellow>No, it's not.</c>

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>For all I know,</c>
<c.yellow>you might have been struck off</c>

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>for being a big bloody weirdo.</c>

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:-3
I resigned.
This isn't about me.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Martin, what are you doing here?</c>

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>And who's looking after</c>
<c.cyan>the children? </c>Janice.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:-3
I'm concerned that you are suffering
from myasthenia gravis.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:-3
Which is a neuromuscular condition
that causes muscle weakness.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I thought you said it was ptosis?</c>

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:-3
One doesn't preclude the other.
<c.yellow>That's convenient (!)</c>

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:-3
You need to seek medical help.
<c.yellow>I have.</c>

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>OK, look, I visited a naturopath</c>

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>and I'm being tested</c>
<c.yellow>for food allergies.</c>

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:-2
That's not a doctor.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Just leave.</c>
<c.cyan>I told you I would handle this.</c>

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:-3
Louisa, with respect,
she doesn't need a child counsellor,

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:-3
she doesn't need
to see a naturopath,

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.960 align:middle line:-3
or a wizard,
she needs to see a doctor.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>"She" is suffering from stress</c>
<c.yellow>and has a lot going on in her life.</c>

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>But OK, fine, fine,</c>

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>when I have more time,</c>
<c.yellow>I will go and see a REAL DOCTOR.</c>

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>OK?</c>

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>But YOU have five seconds!</c>

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:-2
To examine you?

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>To leave me alone</c>
<c.yellow>or I'm calling the police.</c>

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:-2
I am a doctor!

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>And then you proceeded</c>
<c.green>to tell the complainant</c>

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>that she was "stubborn and..."</c>

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Can't read my own writing there.</c>
<c.green>Is that an idiot or imbecile?</c>

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.160 align:middle line:-3
Both are applicable.
<c.green>That's not very nice.</c>

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.960 align:middle line:-3
Neither is respiratory failure
with oropharyngeal collapse

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.960 align:middle line:-2
caused by a myasthenic crisis.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Is that a threat?</c>
What? No. It's a concern.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Look...</c>
<c.green>You're not the doc any more, Doc.</c>

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>You can't just go barging</c>
<c.green>into people's houses</c>

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>and start barking at them.</c>

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Consider this an informal caution.</c>
<c.green>You stay away from her.</c>

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Laying down the law there, Joe.</c>

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.320 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Just doing my job.</c>

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>I'll see myself out.</c>

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Thanks for looking after</c>
<c.cyan>James and Mary, Janice.</c>

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>If you need anything,</c>
<c.yellow>just let me know,</c>

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I am always available.</c>

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Not that I'm desperate or anything.</c>

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>It's not like I spent</c>
<c.yellow>all my life savings on a nail salon</c>

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>that no-one visits, and I'm</c>
<c.yellow>facing crippling debt and ruin.</c>

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Thank you.</c>
<c.cyan>Thanks.</c>

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>What on earth were you doing,</c>
<c.cyan>showing up like that?</c>

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>You've jeopardised</c>
<c.cyan>my job and reputation.</c>

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.960 align:middle line:-2
That woman needs help.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Yes. And I was making progress</c>
<c.cyan>with her, Martin.</c>

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>You know, I've been patient,</c>
<c.cyan>and I've given it time...</c>

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>..but we can't go on like this.</c>

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>YOU can't go on like this.</c>

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.960 align:middle line:-2
She is ill.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Do you regret resigning?</c>

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Do you wish you were still a doctor?</c>

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>It's been a year, Martin. Please.</c>
<c.cyan>Just... just say something.</c>

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.960 align:middle line:-2
Yes.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:-2
I made a mistake.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.960 align:middle line:-2
I thought, erm...

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:-3
I thought that
they'd realise that and, er...

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>And everything</c>
<c.cyan>would just go back to normal?</c>

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:-3
I didn't think
it would go on this long.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.960 align:middle line:-2
And now, I don't know what to do.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>You need to contact them.</c>

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>And you need to apologise.</c>

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.960 align:middle line:-3
I haven't done anything
to apologise for.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Look, I can speak to Abigail,</c>

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>and convince her to see a doctor</c>
<c.cyan>sooner if it's urgent. </c>It is.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>But it's not just her.</c>

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>What about the next person,</c>
<c.cyan>and the person after that?</c>

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>And all those people</c>
<c.cyan>you won't be able to help?</c>

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:-2
You're right. I'll call Chris.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.800 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Martin. What are you doing here?</c>

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:-3
You weren't answering your phone and
Heidi said you were playing golf.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Helen. Is everything all right?</c>
I need your help.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Why, have you decided you want</c>
<c.yellow>to become a doctor again?</c>

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Oh, Martin. It was a joke. Martin.</c>

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Oh, no, no, no...</c>

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.960 align:middle line:-2
What steps do I have to take

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.960 align:middle line:-3
to get registered again
as soon as possible?

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>After what happened last time?</c>
<c.yellow>Goodbye, Martin.</c>

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.960 align:middle line:-3
There's a patient
that needs my help.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Yeah. Then tell 'em to see a doctor.</c>

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:-3
Well, by the time she does,
it might be too late.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:-3
She won't let me examine her
because I'm not registered.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Do you hate me, Martin?</c>
No, of course I don't.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>It feels like you hate me.</c>

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.000 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Or maybe you derive</c>
<c.yellow>a subconscious element of pleasure</c>

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>from torturing me.</c>

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.960 align:middle line:-2
That's a bit overdramatic.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>And with very good reason.</c>

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I stood there</c>
<c.yellow>and defended you to the GMC,</c>

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>and all the while you'd already</c>
<c.yellow>sent them your resignation!</c>

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I looked like a complete idiot.</c>

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.160 align:middle line:-3
Yeah, I meant to tell you.
<c.yellow>But instead you humiliated me.</c>

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Never again, Martin.</c>

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Even if I could help you,</c>
<c.yellow>it's not up to me.</c>

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.160 align:middle line:-3
Whose decision is it?
<c.yellow>Professor Langan's.</c>

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.960 align:middle line:-3
Can you get me a meeting
with Langan?

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>He chaired your hearing panel.</c>
<c.yellow>You threw up in his bin.</c>

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I won't ask him again.</c>

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.160 align:middle line:-3
I've worked on the blood phobia
with my aunt.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.960 align:middle line:-3
And I happen to know that
the NHS is desperate for rural GPs.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:24.000 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>But you haven't changed,</c>
<c.yellow>Martin, and that's what they wanted.</c>

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I mean, look at you.</c>

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You show up here,</c>
<c.yellow>start making demands</c>

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>without so much as a,</c>
<c.yellow>"Hello," or, "How are you?"</c>

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:-3
How are you?
<c.yellow>I'm fine.</c>

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Helen and I are giving</c>
<c.yellow>the marriage another go.</c>

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Work's been quite stressful.</c>

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.160 align:middle line:-3
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
er, but I'm glad that you and...

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Helen.</c>
..Helen are working things out.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:-2
And if I'm brusque, it's because

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.960 align:middle line:-3
I realise that I made
a mistake in resigning.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.960 align:middle line:-3
And I'm not used
to asking for help.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I don't think I've ever heard you</c>
<c.yellow>admit to making a mistake before.</c>

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>It's quite strange.</c>

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.640 align:middle line:-3
Why don't I just go and see
Langan right now?

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>God, no, you can't just show up!</c>

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I need to...</c>
<c.yellow>have a word with him first.</c>

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.480 align:middle line:-2
When?

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>We've got a budget meeting at the</c>
<c.yellow>PCT headquarters tomorrow morning,</c>

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>9:00 till 10:30.</c>

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I'll prep him,</c>
<c.yellow>and then you can plead your case.</c>

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You'll get one shot at this,</c>
<c.yellow>Martin, so be prepared.</c>

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You're gonna have to grovel</c>
<c.yellow>like you've never grovelled before.</c>

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>And even then,</c>
<c.yellow>he will probably say no.</c>

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:-3
In the meantime, is it all right
to examine this patient?

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Absolutely not!</c>

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You're not a doctor yet,</c>
<c.yellow>so don't go jeopardising things.</c>

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>It's all very delicate.</c>

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You can recommend her to someone.</c>
<c.yellow>That's all.</c>

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.960 align:middle line:-2
I understand. 10:30.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.960 align:middle line:-2
Mrs Tishell. What do you want?

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I just wanted you to check my hand,</c>
<c.cyan>to see if it's healing properly.</c>

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.960 align:middle line:-2
Right. Come through.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Oh, Doctor!</c>

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>What has she done</c>
<c.cyan>to your lovely room?</c>

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.800 align:middle line:-2
Here. I'll look at it here.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.960 align:middle line:-2
Yes, that's healing well.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.320 align:middle line:-2
Why are there three staple wounds?

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Well, erm, I was just putting up</c>
<c.cyan>a poster advertising a sale,</c>

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>and stupidly I put my hand</c>
<c.cyan>in the wrong place.</c>

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.960 align:middle line:-3
Yeah, one I can understand,
maybe two. But three?

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>One wasn't enough.</c>

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I thought if there was</c>
<c.cyan>a medical situation, then...</c>

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>maybe you'd remember</c>
<c.cyan>how it felt to be a doctor</c>

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>and then you'd come back.</c>

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.960 align:middle line:-3
That's idiotic.
<c.cyan>Is it?</c>

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Is it idiotic to stand up</c>
<c.cyan>for something you believe in?</c>

00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>To be a lone voice,</c>
<c.cyan>shouting above an indifferent tide?</c>

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:06.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>To try to breathe life back into</c>
<c.cyan>the weary soul of a once great man?</c>

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>If that is idiotic,</c>
<c.cyan>then I am guilty as charged.</c>

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.960 align:middle line:-3
Yeah, stapling your hand
on purpose is idiotic.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle line:-3
You shouldn't do it again.
Thank you, Mrs Tishell.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Hi, Sally. How's your hand?</c>
<c.cyan>It was an accident.</c>

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>So, well, how did it go with Chris?</c>
<c.yellow>Can he get you your job back?</c>

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.160 align:middle line:-3
He's going to have a try. I'm going
to the PCT office in Exeter

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.960 align:middle line:-3
at 10:30 tomorrow morning, to have
a meeting with Professor Langan.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Oh, that sounds promising.</c>

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.960 align:middle line:-2

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.480 align:middle line:-3
What?
<c.cyan>It's been hours.</c>

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>You have to do something.</c>

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.960 align:middle line:-3
Well, I can't just kick him out
on the street, can I?

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:-3
I need to find something
like the pub, where...

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.800 align:middle line:-2
where he can live and work...

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:-2
HE YAWNS

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:-2
But can I do it in the morning?

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.960 align:middle line:-3
SNORING CONTINUES,
SHE GROANS

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Now, remember,</c>
<c.cyan>not to run in the corridors.</c>

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>And listen to the teachers.</c>

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Can you take her?</c>
<c.cyan>Have you got her? </c>Mm-hm.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>And if anyone makes fun</c>
<c.cyan>of your briefcase, you just laugh.</c>

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.960 align:middle line:-2
SHE LAUGHS

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>You laugh</c>
<c.cyan>like you're in on the joke.</c>

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.320 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Stop fussing, Mum.</c>

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>It's your first day at school,</c>
<c.cyan>I'm allowed to fuss.</c>

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Will you have time to come with us?</c>
Er, yes.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:-3
As long as I leave by 8:30,
I should make it.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Now, before you say anything,</c>
<c.yellow>erm, it is a fixer-upper. </c>Yeah.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.960 align:middle line:-3
Don't see it for what it is,
see it for what it could be.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.640 align:middle line:-3
A bustling caravan park,
full of life and colour.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>So I would live on-site, right?</c>
That's the idea.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Well, I've always liked</c>
<c.cyan>a mobile home.</c>

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Perhaps I could change the name?</c>

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Large Caravan Park...?</c>
<c.yellow>Well, no.</c>

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>No, because that just makes it sound</c>
<c.yellow>like a really big caravan park.</c>

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.960 align:middle line:-3
You could do what you like, Bert.
You'd be the boss.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>I'll take it.</c>

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.640 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>You're smart to move fast, Mr Large.</c>

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Very popular location,</c>
<c.green>lots of enquiries about it.</c>

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.960 align:middle line:-2
Oh, and here is the paperwork.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.000 align:middle line:-3
And we would need
two months' rent upfront.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Oh, I-I do have</c>
<c.cyan>a slight cash flow problem.</c>

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.960 align:middle line:-3
OK, erm, well, I'm sure we could
arrange a structured payment plan.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:40.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Within reason.</c>

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Well, here's what I'm thinking,</c>
<c.cyan>right?</c>

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I get the park, and maybe</c>
<c.cyan>an advance for renovations.</c>

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>And then I repay it</c>
<c.cyan>once I've made the money back.</c>

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.960 align:middle line:-2
SHE LAUGHS

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Sorry.</c>
<c.green>You want us to give you money?</c>

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I don't have any.</c>
<c.yellow>But, but what about your nest egg?</c>

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I didn't want you to feel sorry</c>
<c.cyan>for me.</c>

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>It's embarrassing to get to my age</c>
<c.cyan>and have nothing to show for it.</c>

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>I knew it was a mistake giving</c>
<c.green>this property to a trainee.</c>

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.960 align:middle line:-3
No, wait.. Wait, wait, wait.
Just wait.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.960 align:middle line:-2
Al...

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:-3
Didn't you tell me yesterday, you're
about to spend a load of money

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.960 align:middle line:-3
to store your
food trucks and supplies?

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Yeah.</c>
So what if you took that money

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.960 align:middle line:-3
and used it to cover the monthly
rent for this place instead?

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>What about the trucks and supplies?</c>
Well, look around.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.960 align:middle line:-3
You could store them here.
It's a win-win.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Now, that sounds a lot like I'm</c>
<c.yellow>going into business with Dad, and...</c>

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.960 align:middle line:-2
Have you got any better ideas?

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.960 align:middle line:-3
I mean, I know you love having
your dad staying with us...

<c.cyan>Why?</c>

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Well, cos I wanna know</c>

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>which one you're gonna choose</c>
<c.yellow>as your new home.</c>

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.000 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>What about that one, then?</c>
<c.yellow>Er...</c>

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.960 align:middle line:-3
Not that one.
We'll get the cleaners in first.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.800 align:middle line:-2

Yeah. All signed and sealed.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Congratulations, young lady.</c>

<c.green>Welcome to the big league.</c>

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:15.640 align:middle line:-3

<c.cyan>It's like fate.</c>

<c.cyan>Oh.</c>

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>You think I'd be used to it,</c>

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>but it's so weird being on</c>
<c.cyan>the other side, and saying goodbye.</c>

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Goodbye!</c>
<c.cyan>No, I didn't mean...!</c>

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:-2

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.160 align:middle line:-3

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:-3
It's too dangerous to move.
<c.yellow>It's too dangerous not to move.</c>

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>If I pull her out</c>
<c.yellow>at the same time,</c>

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>the counterweight</c>
<c.yellow>will balance the things.</c>

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>It's basic chemistry.</c>

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:-3
Physics.
<c.yellow>Exactly!</c>

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Ma'am, I'm gonna have to be</c>
<c.yellow>a little bit rough.</c>

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>For that, I apologise.</c>

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>All right, Doc.</c>
<c.yellow>On the count of ten. </c>Ten?!

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Right, no, five would be better.</c>
<c.yellow>It's much quicker.</c>

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Actually, now I think about it,</c>
<c.yellow>we could just do it in...</c>

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.960 align:middle line:-3
Just do it now! Ready?
<c.yellow>OK. </c>GO!

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.960 align:middle line:-2
OK.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.960 align:middle line:-2
Wait... and... go!

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Dynamic duo.</c>
Yeah. Get her on to the bank there.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:01.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Good job, Doc.</c>

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.960 align:middle line:-3
Yeah, well,
she's not out of the woods yet.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:-3
She's had a myasthenic crisis.
That means that all the muscles

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.960 align:middle line:-3
associated with breathing
have stopped.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.960 align:middle line:-2
PHONE RINGS

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.960 align:middle line:-2
Oh, here. You keep squeezing.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.960 align:middle line:-2
Louisa?

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.800 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Oh, Martin. What's happening?</c>

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.960 align:middle line:-3
She's fine. She almost
drove off a cliff, though.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>What?</c>

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.960 align:middle line:-3
Yeah, an ambulance is on its way.
She's all right.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>'Thank God.'</c>

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Er, I should make sure</c>
<c.cyan>Dylan's all right.</c>

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>'Well, you better get a move on,</c>
<c.cyan>or you'll miss Professor Langan.'</c>

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.960 align:middle line:-3
Yes, I know. I'll get there
as quick as I can.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:-3
CAR CREAKS
Bye.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:41.960 align:middle line:-2
CRASHING

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Look, he said he's on his way.</c>

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>If it was that important to him,</c>
<c.green>he'd already be here.</c>

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>You're very loyal, Christopher.</c>

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>That's not always a good thing.</c>
<c.yellow>Hello.</c>

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I have collected</c>
<c.yellow>over 5,000 signatures</c>

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>demanding the reinstatement</c>
<c.yellow>of Dr Martin Ellingham.</c>

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.800 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Did you write all these?</c>

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>That's a very serious accusation.</c>

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>It wouldn't matter anyway,</c>
<c.green>it's not a popularity contest.</c>

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.000 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>But you have to wait</c>
<c.yellow>to see the doctor.</c>

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>I'm sorry, who are you?</c>
<c.cyan>I think she's the local chemist.</c>

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>No, I'm a licensed pharmacist</c>
<c.yellow>and a concerned citizen.</c>

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>What are you doing?</c>
<c.cyan>A chemist.</c>

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I'm not letting you leave</c>
<c.yellow>until you've seen the doctor.</c>

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>No, no, no, don't do that!</c>

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>What on earth is wrong with you?</c>

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Doc, tell him</c>
<c.yellow>it was a learning experience.</c>

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Completely meaningless,</c>
<c.yellow>but works every time.</c>

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.800 align:middle line:-3
Professor Langan.
<c.green>Ellingham.</c>

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.960 align:middle line:-2
What are you doing here?

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.480 align:middle line:-2
SHE MUMBLES

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>She's got Professor Langan's</c>
<c.cyan>car keys in her mouth.</c>

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.000 align:middle line:-3
SHE MUMBLES
Spit them out, right now.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.960 align:middle line:-3
SHE GROANS
Now!

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.960 align:middle line:-3
Go away.
<c.yellow>What if you need moral support?</c>

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.320 align:middle line:-2
I don't. Thank you. Go away.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Thank you.</c>

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Martin, you...</c>
<c.cyan>you wanted to say something?</c>

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.960 align:middle line:-2
Yes. Er, I'd like to practise again,

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.960 align:middle line:-3
and I'm aware that it's appropriate
that I apologise for what happened.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Go on.</c>

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.960 align:middle line:-3
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I'm not entirely clear

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.480 align:middle line:-3
exactly what it is I'm supposed to
be apologising for,

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.960 align:middle line:-3
but I do confess
that I made a mistake

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.000 align:middle line:-2
when I resigned from medicine.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.960 align:middle line:-2
I was surprised, though,

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.960 align:middle line:-3
at your readiness
to accept that resignation.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>So it's my fault? Right!</c>

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Nice to see you again, Ellingham.</c>

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.320 align:middle line:-3
Professor Langan,
the reason I'm late is...

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.960 align:middle line:-3
I just performed an intubation
on a patient suffering

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.960 align:middle line:-3
a myasthenic crisis while her car
was perched on the edge of a cliff.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>No, no, no, no, you didn't, Martin.</c>

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Because that would be very bad.</c>

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.640 align:middle line:-3
There is a policeman here
who can verify those facts.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.960 align:middle line:-3
If you don't reinstate me,
I must insist

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.960 align:middle line:-3
that you have me arrested for
practising without a licence,

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.960 align:middle line:-3
under the outlines
of The Medical Act of 1983.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Are you giving me an ultimatum?</c>

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.960 align:middle line:-2
No, I'm giving you a promise.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.640 align:middle line:-3
If I hadn't acted,
that woman would have died.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.960 align:middle line:-3
So I will continue to treat
my patients

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.960 align:middle line:-2
and do the best I can for them,

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.960 align:middle line:-3
regardless
of the consequences to myself.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.960 align:middle line:-3
Also...
it's been a learning experience.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>Fine.</c>

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.960 align:middle line:-2
Fine?

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>You're a good doctor</c>
<c.green>and we need good doctors.</c>

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.green>There'll be paperwork to shuffle</c>

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>and a written retraction</c>
<c.green>of resignation will be required,</c>

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>then an appraisal - but as you said,</c>
<c.green>you've learned from this.</c>

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>And maybe that's</c>
<c.green>the most important thing of all.</c>

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>I will recommend to the GMC</c>
<c.green>that you are relicensed.</c>

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.480 align:middle line:-2
Thank you, sir.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.960 align:middle line:-3
So what happens now?
<c.cyan>What do you mean "what happens now"?</c>

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>You've got what you wanted,</c>
<c.cyan>you're a doctor again.</c>

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I mean, don't think you need</c>
<c.cyan>to thank me or anything. </c>Hmm.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>I mean, you can, if you want to.</c>

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:06.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>I did put my reputation</c>
<c.cyan>on the line for you.</c>

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.320 align:middle line:-2
Yes. You're right.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Welcome back, Martin.</c>

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>My last job was</c>
<c.yellow>a hotel receptionist.</c>

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>This is probably way easier, though.</c>

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.640 align:middle line:-3
So, is the doc up for moving, then?
<c.cyan>We're just looking. That's all.</c>

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.green>Louisa has her heart set</c>
<c.green>on West Cliff House.</c>

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:30.960 align:middle line:-2
This house isn't for sale.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I gave her 40 years of my life.</c>
<c.yellow>You'd think that would be enough.</c>

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Winnie's... dead, though.</c>
<c.yellow>What you doing here?!</c>

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.960 align:middle line:-2
Just put the jug down, please.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>This is not what it seems, Doc.</c>

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.960 align:middle line:-2
