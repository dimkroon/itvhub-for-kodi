JULIA BRADBURY: 'The best way
to see the true landscape

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:0
'of Cornwall and Devon
is on foot.'

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.320 align:middle line:-2
Britain is a walkers' paradise,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.640 align:middle line:-3
and these two counties
are packed with beautiful walks.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.960 align:middle line:0
Just another epic cove in Cornwall.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.800 align:middle line:-3
'With over 5,000 miles
of footpaths...'

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.960 align:middle line:-3
You've got to follow
the wonderful curves of the river.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:-3
'..across spectacular
and varied landscapes.'

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:-3

'From the rugged rocks of Dartmoor,
to the picturesque port of Padstow.'

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:0
Life-affirmingly good.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:0
'And en route,
I'll be seeking out

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle line:0
'the counties' most

so unique.'

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:-3
So, walk with me, it's going to be
an adventure you'll never forget.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:-3
Today, my Cornwall
and Devon adventure

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:-3
is taking me all along the
ruggedly beautiful Cornish coastline

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:-3
to the panoramic seascape
of Land's End.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.160 align:middle line:0
'This stretch of coastline
in west Cornwall

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:0
'is known for its
mythical landscapes

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:0
'and a special quality of light

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:0
'that's said to have
inspired artists for centuries.

'Today's six-and-a-half mile walk

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.320 align:middle line:-3
'is bookended by two
beautiful sandy beaches,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:-3
'but it's got some
challenging bits in the middle.

'I'm told the light and beauty
of this landscape

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:-3

Kurt, hello. What is this?
Extreme painting?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Yeah, well, we're on the edge,</c>
<c.yellow>that's for sure.</c>

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.960 align:middle line:-3
Literally, on the edge.
JULIA LAUGHS

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:-3
'Kurt Jackson is one of the UK's
most important contemporary artists,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:-3
'and as a dedicated
environmentalist,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:-3
'his work celebrates
the natural world.'

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I like dramatic places,</c>
<c.yellow>marginal places.</c>

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I like where the elements</c>
<c.yellow>are coming at you full force</c>

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>and, you know, nature in the raw,</c>
<c.yellow>this is what gets me going.</c>

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:-3
Well, you have got it here
in spades. I love this,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:-3
I love the way you splash
and use your brushes.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>It's got layers of collage on here</c>
<c.yellow>first of hessian and granite dust,</c>

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>and I quite like the idea</c>

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>that to include</c>
<c.yellow>the actual geology of the place</c>

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>in with the paint.</c>

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:-3
Why do you think this corner
of the UK is so enticing to artists?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>There has always been this argument</c>
<c.yellow>that it's about the lights,</c>

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>because we're in the far west,</c>

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>so you get this</c>
<c.yellow>strong sunlight, clean air.</c>

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>There's something about the geology,</c>

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>the silica suspended in the water</c>
<c.yellow>that's reflecting the light.</c>

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You do get these intense colours</c>
<c.yellow>and glimmers in the sea.</c>

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>West Cornwall has basically</c>
<c.yellow>had two revolutions in modern art.</c>

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>One in the late 1800s,</c>
<c.yellow>with the Newlyn School of Artists,</c>

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>and they were attracted</c>
<c.yellow>because Cornwall</c>

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>was full of an old romance to them</c>
<c.yellow>in terms of the fishing community.</c>

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>And then it all picked up again</c>
<c.yellow>in the post war</c>

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>when the real revolution</c>
<c.yellow>in modern art happened</c>

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>with the abstract artists</c>
<c.yellow>based more around St Ives,</c>

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>so up the coast a bit.</c>

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:-3
Yeah. So, my walk today
is Porthcurno to Land's End.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.960 align:middle line:-3
I know that you're a walker.
What can I...

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.960 align:middle line:-3
What can I look out for
and enjoy along the way?

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>It's a very rugged stretch of coast,</c>
<c.yellow>it's a raw landscape,</c>

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>we're, like, facing west,</c>
<c.yellow>the storms arrive here first.</c>

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Obviously,</c>
<c.yellow>the sun's going in and out,</c>

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>the light's changing,</c>
<c.yellow>the tide's coming in and out.</c>

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.800 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>It's an Area Of Outstanding</c>
<c.yellow>Natural Beauty,</c>

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>it's just absolutely chock-a-block</c>
<c.yellow>with natural wonders.</c>

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:-3
'After meeting Kurt,
I'm beginning to understand

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:0
'why artists find this landscape
so alluring.'

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.960 align:middle line:-3
I'm never gonna look at those cliffs
in the same way again.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:-2
'The first mile of my walk

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:-3
'leads me from the white sands
of Porthcurno Beach,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:-2
'past the Minack Theatre,

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.960 align:middle line:-3
'onto an ancient well
called St Levan's.'

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.960 align:middle line:-2
Wow! I could be in Greece.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:-3
So, Porthcurno Beach
is a jewel of Cornwall.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:-3
It's won more awards
than Meryl Streep

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:-3
for its white sands
and turquoise waters.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:-3
But it's not just
a good-looking beach.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:-3
This is a place
with a few stories to tell.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.960 align:middle line:-3
This beach has played
a pioneering role

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:-2
in global communications.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:-3
The largest telegraph station
in the world

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:-2
was situated right here.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:-3
And the first cable
was laid in 1870,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:-3
connecting the UK
to the rest of the globe.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:-2
Under there!

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.960 align:middle line:-3
It's a bit mad
when you think about it.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:0
I like the body-boogiers as well.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:0
It's hilarious that this
is telecommunications HQ,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.960 align:middle line:0
and now everyone's body boogie-ing.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.960 align:middle line:0
'Porthcurno Beach
was the site of the UK's

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:0
'largest telegraph station
because of its secluded location.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.960 align:middle line:0
'But when World War Two started,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.960 align:middle line:0
'this communication hub
was under the threat of attack.'

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:-2
A few weeks after the war started,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:-3
the decision was made
to protect the station

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:-3
and they moved everything,
lock, stock and barrel, underground.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:0
'This route continues from the beach
up to the top of the headland

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:0
'via a set of steep steps.

'because these cliffs
are home to an important place

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:0
'for the performing arts.'

'The Minack is a breath-taking
open-air theatre

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:0
'built into the rocks.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:0
'And it's the work of a local
resident called Rowena Cade

'who constructed it by hand
at the bottom of her garden.'

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.640 align:middle line:0
She was obviously quite a woman
to create all of this.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:0
There's a story from the '50s

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:-3
that a Spanish freight ship
got wrecked in the cove,

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:-3
and apparently,
Rowena went onto the ship

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.960 align:middle line:-3
and started lifting
these 15ft beams off it

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:-3
and carting them up the cliff
to bring and use at the theatre.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.960 align:middle line:-2
And when the police questioned her,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:-3
they immediately
eliminated her from inquiries

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:-3
because they thought
she was too waify

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:-3
to have managed
to cart them up here.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:-2
But she had. And she did!

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:-3
Phil, you've stolen the sun!
Where's it gone?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>It'll be back.</c>
<c.cyan>I'm so sorry about that.</c>

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>It happens here, but it doesn't</c>
<c.cyan>make any difference to us,</c>

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>we play and do things</c>
<c.cyan>whatever the weather.</c>

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:-3
'The theatre runs
around 30 productions a year,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:-2
'from Easter to late October.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:-3
'And it's the job of manager Phil
to keep things going.'

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:-3
Now, I've just been talking about
the formidable Rowena Cade.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:-3
I think that's the right word for
her, she was a woman of ambition...

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>She was.</c>
..and purpose. And you met her?

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>It's a good word, formidable.</c>
<c.cyan>I mean, she always reminded me</c>

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>of my head mistress</c>
<c.cyan>at primary school.</c>

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>She was Cheltenham Ladies' College</c>
<c.cyan>educated,</c>

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.960 align:middle line:0
<c.cyan>but mixing concrete with her hands</c>
<c.cyan>and had a vision and made it happen.</c>

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:-3
And I imagine as it grew,
the theatre grew in its popularity,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.960 align:middle line:-3
it must just have become
so much more important to her,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.960 align:middle line:-3
not just the project in her garden,
it then became an important...

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:-3
such an important part
of this community.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Absolutely, and that's how</c>
<c.cyan>it really started it,</c>

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:-3

<c.cyan>Company,</c>

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>they suddenly put a load of educated</c>
<c.cyan>engineers from London into a valley</c>

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>where there was farmers</c>
<c.cyan>and fishermen and nobody else.</c>

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>To keep themselves interested,</c>

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>the company built them a theatre</c>
<c.cyan>down in the valley,</c>

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>and Rowena got involved with that,</c>
<c.cyan>helping out.</c>

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>She was a seamstress,</c>
<c.cyan>she was very talented,</c>

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>so she was making costumes and props</c>
<c.cyan>for these little performances.</c>

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>And they decided</c>
<c.cyan>to do an open-air Shakespeare.</c>

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>So, they did</c>
<c.cyan>A Midsummer Night's Dream</c>

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>in the wood back up in the valley.</c>

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>And then they thought,</c>
<c.cyan>"Well, that went pretty well,</c>

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>"let's have a go at The Tempest."</c>

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>And the cliffs would be, obviously,</c>
<c.cyan>a great place for The Tempest,</c>

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>and this was her garden</c>
<c.cyan>and she was...</c>

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.480 align:middle line:-3
So, that's what sparked it for her?
<c.cyan>That's what sparked it.</c>

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>She built a stage for her friends</c>
<c.cyan>to put on The Tempest in 1932.</c>

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>No great plans</c>
<c.cyan>for it to be here 90 years later.</c>

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>That wasn't in her planning,</c>
<c.cyan>that's the way it's turned out.</c>

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:-3
'Rowena passed away in 1983

to be honest.

as is the sunshine.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:-3
I'm gonna ask you here
to do a little favour

to mountain rescue teams
all across the country.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.960 align:middle line:-3
When you go for your walk
and it's glorious sunshine,

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:-2
please pack your waterproofs

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:-3
and different weather gear
in your backpack

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:-3
because so many people
get it wrong,

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.640 align:middle line:-3
and by the end of the day,
they get stuck in bad weather.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:-3
And it does change,
that is just the rule of walking.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.960 align:middle line:-3
What a lovely, lovely little cove.
So, this is Porthgwarra.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.960 align:middle line:-3
And that moody tunnel
that I walked through -

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:-3
and you can see a couple more
around here -

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:-2
that was hand carved by farmers

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:-3
so they could get their horses and
carts down here back in the day,

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:-2
load up with this sea weed,

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:-3
and get it back out there
onto agricultural land

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:-2
to use as fertilizer.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:-3
And the tunnels were probably
used by smugglers as well.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:-2
Highly likely, I'd say,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.960 align:middle line:-3
because they look very
smugglers-covey, don't they?

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.960 align:middle line:-2
A lot of Poldark filming here, too.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.960 align:middle line:-3
But we don't talk about Poldark
because it's on the BBC.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:-3
'Porthgwarra is last settlement

'You have to be reasonably fit
to do this walk,

'as there are around 1,355 feet

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.800 align:middle line:-3
'And watch your step, because
there are some deadly drops.'

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.960 align:middle line:-3
Well, there's rugged
Cornish coastline,

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:-3
and then there's just
ridiculousness.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:-3
I mean, this is a bit like
dicing with death.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:-2
On this side, you've got a blowhole

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.960 align:middle line:-3
that plummets all the way
down to the sea.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:-3
I mean, it's properly
scary and steep.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle line:-3
And then on this side,
you've got a sheer cliff face.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:-3
But look at it,
look at this landscape, just look!

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.960 align:middle line:-2
Look where I've come from.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.320 align:middle line:-3
Through the mist,
over these jagged rocks.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:-3
You sort of expect dinosaurs
to loom around.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.960 align:middle line:-3
You can't complain about
the drama here, that's for sure.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:-2
Oh! Steady, heart!

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:-3

'from Gwennap Head to Land's End.'

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.960 align:middle line:-3
I go walking at least
two or three times a week

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:-3
and not always in dramatic
landscapes like this.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:-3
I go to my local park,
or the canal, over bridges...

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:-3
If I've ever got a problem,
go for a good walk,

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:-3
and genuinely,
things become clearer.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:-3
There he is!
Hello, J, how are you?

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.960 align:middle line:-3

as a landscape?

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:-3
Psychotherapist Jonathan uses walks
in nature to treat his clients,

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:-3
and I've invited him
to talk me through the benefits

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:-2
of being outdoors.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:-3
So, what is it about walking,
what does it do to our brains,

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.960 align:middle line:-2
why is it so good for us?

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>So, right now, we know that</c>
<c.yellow>we're living in a culture...</c>

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>of stress.</c>
Yeah.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>But when we're stressed,</c>
<c.yellow>we can't think...</c>

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.960 align:middle line:-3
And that's when anxiety
and all of those things kick in.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Stress is an energy that goes</c>
<c.yellow>inwards, rather than outwards,</c>

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>you've got no way to channel it out,</c>

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>and that's the great thing</c>
<c.yellow>about walking,</c>

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>it's great for creative thinking,</c>
<c.yellow>it's great for processing emotions.</c>

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>It's an absolute life requirement</c>
<c.yellow>that we need.</c>

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.640 align:middle line:-2
This is what we HAVE to do?

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>This is a fundamental requirement,</c>
<c.yellow>in my opinion,</c>

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>for what we need to do</c>
<c.yellow>to manage our mental health.</c>

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>And the great thing about it,</c>

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>we can do it as often as we like,</c>
<c.yellow>and it's free.</c>

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:-3
While it's not always possible
to venture far from home,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:-3
any outdoor green space can have
a transformative effect on us.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.960 align:middle line:-3
It doesn't have to be an hour,
does it?

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>20 minutes is enough just to kind of</c>
<c.yellow>lower the stress hormones,</c>

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>and it makes a huge difference,</c>
<c.yellow>it really does.</c>

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.960 align:middle line:-3
Most cities in and around the UK
have got a park, green spaces,

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.960 align:middle line:-3
so find them!
<c.yellow>They're everywhere,</c>

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>absolutely everywhere.</c>
What do you think of that?

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Well, it doesn't get better</c>
<c.yellow>than that, does it?</c>

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:-3
It's a really special part
of the countryside here.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>And it gives you instant head space,</c>
<c.yellow>for me. </c>Yeah.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>It really does, you know.</c>
And creativity.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Well, it's a picture in itself,</c>
<c.yellow>isn't it?</c>

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>How can this not spark creativity,</c>
<c.yellow>you know.</c>

Yayyy-hey!

Whoo! Hello, Land's End!

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:-2
Oh, the air is so fresh!

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:-2
Breath-taking. Really is.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.800 align:middle line:-3
This is the perfect
panoramic seascape.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:-2
What a magical spot.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:-3
'This is a scene
that's been celebrated

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:-3
'in numerous paintings,

'by the artist Joseph Turner.'

This is the most westerly point

SHE CHUCKLES

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:-2
But I've got one more...

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:-3
one more little treat
before I go home.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:-3
'Another mile until Sennen Cove, and
I started this walk with an artist,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:-3
Tony, hello, hello. <c.yellow>Hi, Julia.</c>
I recognise the man with the rake,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.320 align:middle line:-3
it must be you!
<c.yellow>It must be, yeah.</c>

So, this is huge, the bits that
I can see that are still remaining.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:-3
How long have you been
working on this?

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>About four or five hours ago</c>
<c.yellow>I think I started it,</c>

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>but most of it's gone now, in truth.</c>

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>It's inevitable, so...</c>
<c.yellow>Somebody once came up to me</c>

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>and said they admired my optimism,</c>

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>when they saw one of these,</c>
<c.yellow>and so I work on found objects</c>

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>and this is a massive found object,</c>
<c.yellow>the beach,</c>

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.000 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>it changes every single day,</c>
<c.yellow>changes every single tide,</c>

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>it changes colour with the wind.</c>

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Everything is in flux</c>
<c.yellow>and the edges are always moving,</c>

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>the edges are not fixed,</c>
<c.yellow>like a painting,</c>

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>so I have been doing this</c>
<c.yellow>for a long time</c>

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>and I'm just gonna</c>
<c.yellow>keep doing this forever.</c>

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:-2
Look, there's a man standing

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:-3
right in the middle
of one of your circles!

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.960 align:middle line:-2
Look!

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:-3
I love that. And then he's going
into the middle of the next one.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>You get great reactions from people.</c>

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:-3
Because you don't signpost
when you're working, do you?

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:-2
You don't let anybody know,

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:-3
so people will then just accidently
walk into something like this,

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:-3
and you don't mind...
<c.yellow>There's no point.</c>

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I'm serious about it,</c>
<c.yellow>but I'm not precious, and so...</c>

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.160 align:middle line:-2
And that is a part of it for you,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.960 align:middle line:-3
watching people's reaction
when they first come across...

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:-3
This is a very creative
little corner of the world here,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:-3
isn't it? It's definitely
in the Cornish blood, the art.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>It is, but I think it's because</c>
<c.yellow>the landscape is so...</c>

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:-2
Impermanent?

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Impermanent, and beautiful, really,</c>
<c.yellow>it's just absolutely beautiful.</c>

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:-3
I'm going to head down there...
<c.yellow>Yep.</c>

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:-3
..and become a part
of your painting,

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:-2
before it completely disappears.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Good luck with that.</c>
Thank you.

the leaves falling off the trees,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:-3
and the coastline,

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.960 align:middle line:-3
